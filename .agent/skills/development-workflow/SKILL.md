# Development Workflow Agent

Use this agent for feature work and architectural changes.

## Scope

- Spec-first delivery
- Test-first implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Verification and PR preparation

## Core Flow

Spec -> Tests (failing) -> Implement -> Verify -> PR

## Phases

1. Specification
- Create `docs/specs/NNN-*.md`
- Request explicit approval before coding
- Add ADR if architectural choice is non-obvious

2. Test-First (Red)
- Create feature branch
- Mark spec `Approved`
- Write failing tests
- Confirm failure before implementation

3. Implementation (Green)
- Implement minimum required behavior
- Follow approved spec exactly
- Pause for user decision if spec ambiguity appears

4. Verify and PR
- Run full test suite with coverage
- Mark spec `Implemented`
- Open PR and hand off to PR review workflow
- For review-thread cleanup during handoff, use:
  - `bash .agent/scripts/resolve-review-threads.sh --repo <owner>/<repo> --pr <number> --mode outdated --dry-run`
  - `bash .agent/scripts/resolve-review-threads.sh --repo <owner>/<repo> --pr <number> --mode outdated`
